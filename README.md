# Slideshow

Minimalistic slideshow that walks over a full directory hierarchy containing files having a filename "name (01).jpg".
The name without the number is shown over the photo as a kind of title.
The photos are shown in alphabetical order.
Some limited interaction is possible (up, down, pageup, pagedown, home) but only on the main window.
